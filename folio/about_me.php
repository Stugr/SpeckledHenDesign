<? InsertWork(1,null,"I remember the day when my music teacher gave us a project to design a CD cover. I will never forget how  excited I got and how much fun I had doing it. It was then and there that I realised what my passion in life was. \"Everything is designed, few things are designed well.\" Brian Reed","Since completing a Diploma of Graphic Arts / Visual Communications in 2002, I have developed a broad range of graphic design experience in both Australia and the UK. I began my career in Torquay, Victoria, developing t-shirt designs for Quiksilver and Ghanda. My determination to enhance my skills and gain international experience, led me to London in 2006.  Here, I was fortunate to work on projects for well-known companies such as Orange Mobile (UK), Old Navy (USA) and Penta Hotels (Germany).","Using my 6 years of design experience, I will ensure your projects are of the highest quality and meet all your expectations and requirements. If you're not sure how you want your product to look, leave that with me. I will research trends and markets and develop a professional design which suits your needs."," If you like what you see, please download my CV <a href=\"".BASE_URL."downloads/stephen_peck_resume.pdf\">here</a>  or feel free to contact me at <a href=\"mailto:info@speckledhendesign.com\">info@speckledhendesign.com</a>  or on  <strong>0451 073 531.</strong>
